# X-MIMO
Welcome to our Corss-technology Channel Estimation Tool. Out tool consists of two parts: (i), fragments injection, which injects the customized WiFi fragments with precise timing control. (ii), channel estimation, which estimates the cross-technology channel from the channel state information (CSI) collected from the injected fragments. Our implementation follow the design in [[1]](#1)
